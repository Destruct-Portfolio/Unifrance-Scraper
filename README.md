# Unifrance Scraper

## How to use

Install the dependencies by running `npm install` then, start the scrapper using `npm start`. You can find the results of your scraping session at `./storage/key_value_stores/default/movies.json`.

There is a config file `.env` that you can use to change how many years ago you want the search to be.
